# Task
Build a simple Vault system that allows users to deposit and withdraw Ether.

# Requirements

1. Use a Library for math
2. Emit an Event when a user deposits or withdraws.
3. Use require() or revert() to prevent over-withdrawing ETH or depositing 0 ETH
4. Implement Inheritance:
5. Base contract: VaultBase (defines structure and shared logic)
6. Derived contract: VaultManager (implements deposit/withdraw functions)
